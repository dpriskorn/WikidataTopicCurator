## Inspiration
This app was inspired by [topictagger](https://github.com/lubianat/topictagger), AuthorDisambiguator and Scholia.
The bootstrap layout was inspired by [Wikidata Lexeme Forms](https://lexeme-forms.toolforge.org/)

## What I learned
* it's nice to separate frontend and backend
* versioning of backend apis is easy with FastAPI :)
* the syntax of flask and FastAPI seem very similar
* * DeepSeek is very good at both React and Python :)

## Effort
This software is a product of about two weeks work of time.
